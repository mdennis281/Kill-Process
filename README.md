# Kill-Process
I made this quick script as a solution to be able to quickly and easily search, and bulk kill processes in windows. Nothing special, but I do use this every time I need to kill a process
 
 It behaves best when it is ran in a directory linked to the PATH envronment variable.
 
 * Usage: 
      * run the command: **kill-process**
      * search, and select the process(es) you want to kill
      * click "ok"
      
      
 Tip: some processes need to be killed using an elevated PS terminal
